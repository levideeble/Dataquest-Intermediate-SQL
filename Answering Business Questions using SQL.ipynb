    "# Answering Business Questions using SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will answer a variety of business questions by using SQL to query a SQLite database file, `chinook.db`. The Chinook database contains information on a fictional digital music store such as employees, customers, tracks/artists and sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Chinook Database Schema](images/chinook-schema.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The above schema diagram shows the tables within the Chinook database and how they are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are 11 tables in the Chinook database.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **employee** table stores employees data such as employee id, last name, first name, etc. It also has a field named reports_to to specify who reports to whom.\n",
    "2. **customer** table stores customers data.\n",
    "3. **invoice** table stores invoice header data\n",
    "4. **invoice_line** table stores the invoice <u title=\"The term “line item” refers to any service or product added to an invoice, along with any quantities, rates, and prices that pertain to them.\">line items data</u>.\n",
    "5. **artist** table stores artists data. It is a simple table that contains only artist_id and name.\n",
    "6. **album** table stores data about a list of tracks. Each album belongs to one artist. However, one artist may have multiple albums.\n",
    "7. **media_type** table stores media types such as MPEG audio and AAC audio file.\n",
    "8. **genre** table stores music types such as rock, jazz, metal, etc.\n",
    "9. **track** table store the data of songs. Each track belongs to one album.\n",
    "10. **playlist** table store data about playlists. Each playlist contains a list of tracks. Each track may belong to multiple playlists. The relationship between the playlist table and track table is <u title=\"A many-to-many relationship refers to a relationship between tables in a database when a parent row in one table contains several child rows in the second table, and vice versa.\">many-to-many</u>.\n",
    "11. **playlist_track** table is used to reflect this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Helper Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us with our visualisations, we will use `pandas` to write queries that produce dataframe outputs. The advantage of dataframe outputs is that they will display as tables in Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also create some helper functions in python to save time and use a context manager to handle the connection to the SQLite database. "
